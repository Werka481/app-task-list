## Demo
https://werka481.github.io/app-task-list/
## Description
The app allows you to add a to-do list. You can mark each task as done. You can also delete a task from the list. There is also a button in the application that hides or shows completed tasks. There is also a button responsible for completing all tasks at the same time. After all tasks are completed, the button becomes inactive. I invite you to watch the instructions.
